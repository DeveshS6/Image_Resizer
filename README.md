Image_Resizer

About the module:
- This module allows the users to upload an image file.
- It then checks for valid file type (jpeg/jpg/png only) and size (below 2KB) uploaded by the user.
- The module then resizes and compresses the image and uploads it to a local folder specified.

## Quick Start

- Install the Python Pillow library using the below given command in command line

```javascript
pip install pillow
```
- Create 2 folders called uploads/images, the uploads folder contains the images folder where the resized and compressed images uploaded by the user will be saved.

## Resized Image examples
- These are some test image files that were resized and compressed
- The images that were uploaded are compressed to almost 1% of the original size
- Higher is the image file size greater is the compression observed
